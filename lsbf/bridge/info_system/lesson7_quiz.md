5. Briefly describe the purpose of DEPLOYMENT UML model.
   1. Main Purpose:
      ● Describes the physical architecture of the system
      ● Shows how software components are distributed across hardware nodes
      ● Represents runtime configuration of the system
      ● Illustrates physical resource allocation
   2. Specific Functions:
      ● Hardware Configuration:
      ● Shows physical devices like servers and workstations
      ● Describes network connections
      ● Identifies system environment
      ● Software Distribution:
      ● Demonstrates how components are deployed to physical nodes
      ● Shows distribution of software artifacts
      ● Describes runtime dependencies
   3. Key Elements:
      ● Nodes: Physical devices
      ● Components: Software units
      ● Artifacts: Physical files
      ● Connections: Communication paths
   4. Value:
      ● Helps plan system deployment
      ● Optimizes resource allocation
      ● Evaluates system performance
      ● Supports maintenance and scaling
      The deployment diagram is particularly important for system architects and operations teams as it provides a clear view of the system's actual operating environment.
